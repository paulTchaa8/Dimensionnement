# Dimensionnement Panneau Solaire

## The PROJECT
The goal of this small project was to make a user interface that allows an electrician to get easily the 
technical values of the power and the energy for a given charge, e.g. iron, TV, computer, freezer ...
However, this was a personal challenge in order to revise the skills I've acquired during the **front-end 
development challenge course** granted for young Africans by *Google, Udacity* and the mervelous _Andela Learning 
Community_ . I think I've got it, especially by using jQuery, a javascript library I scared about.

By the grace of God, I slowly but surely keep going onto my main goal: To become a `great Developer`
