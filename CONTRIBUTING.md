## the CONTRIBUTION

However, I have an issue and I'm still working on it. So each proposition or feedback will be more aprreciated.

## The GOAL

the goal of this, is to be able to add dynamically line(s) as you see I did on the project. Tough, I want to be able
 to consider the values on the fields in the newly generated line(s) when recalculating the _total power_(the button 
 `puissance totale`) and the _energy_(the button `energie`). therefore, it would be easy to add a line as well as wished
  so that we'll no longer have to know about the number of charges before generating the appropriate line(s).
 
 ## INSTALL
 Not tough at all. Just download or clone the project, and `**THERE WE GO!**`. 
 
 ## HOW TO CREATE COMMIT
 
 Just to say that when creating a `topic branch`, it should start by the _elec-_ statement `elec-loop` for instance.
